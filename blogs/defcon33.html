Here's a late DefCon post! (Same month counts, right?)
<br>
<br>
tl;dr: I met amazing people, learned from them, and won my first CTF!
<br>
<br>
This year I attended my first DefCon. I had no idea what to expect, as I had only really heard about it from the Darknet Diaries podcast. 
<br>
<br>
Because this was my first ever cybersecurity event, I organized a climbing meetup on Day 1. Since I'm very comfortable socializing in a climbing gym, I figured that I could make use of my sport in order to create some connections in the cyber world. I quickly met the witty Luke McGuinness, and we quickly bonded over a shared interest in both scaling small rocks and breaking into computer systems. (A small caveat is that Luke is a full-fledged pentester and I have merely dreamt of such activities). 
<br>
<br>
In the afternoon, I spent some time in the merch line chatting with David Broggy. A funny happenstance is that he and my dad, and his son and me both share the same name (Dave and Jake, respectively). I was very grateful to have the opportunity to talk with someone who has so much experience in the field. 
<br>
<br>
On Day 2, I picked up some fun new toys from the vendors, then headed over to the villages where I was quickly overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the event. This was the day that I won my first CTF, but the story exceeded the character limit of a LinkedIn post, so you can find the writeup on my GitHub at some point at https://github.com/korekim. That night, I attended the Bishop Fox party with Luke and met David Rushmer, MSc, Christopher Hansen, Peter Van Splunder, and James, whom I forgot to exchange contact information with. Everyone had such interesting jobs, and I had a blast listening to stories about engagments and showing off my shiny new Keysight hardware hacking case that I had earned in the CTF.
<br>
<br>
I'm running out of characters, so I'll make the rest short. The next couple of days I attended talks about OT and ICS security by Mike Holcomb, and hung out with the group whilst meandering around the various villages.
<br>
<br>
All in all, it was an amazing event, and I can't wait to attend next year! Thanks to everyone who made it a great time, and I hope to see y'all soon!
