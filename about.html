Originally from Santa Monica, California, I moved to Boulder, Colorado, to pursue both my education and my passion of rock climbing. I originally attended CU Boulder as a Chemistry Major, but realized that it was not the subject for me. I took a year of academic leave to re-evaluate my interests, explored different areas of interest, and discovered that I could apply the skills that I learned in climbing to cybersecurity. (You can find a blogpost about that <a href="./blogs/climbing-and-cyber.html"><strong>here</strong></a>). 
<br>
<br>
I started pursuing my BS in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at Western Governor's University in July 2024, and quickly fell in love with the subject. I spent the first year of the program mainly focusing on gaining certifications, but after <a href="./blogs/defcon33.html"><strong>Defcon33</strong></a>,  I've taken on many personal projects to get more hands-on experience. These projects will probably pop up <a href="./projects.html"><strong>here</strong></a> and/or on my LinkedIn, so keep an eye out!
<br>
<br>
Now, I'm very interested in internship opportunities in cybersecurity. I'm excited to put my expanding skillset to the test, and absorb as much information as I can to become the best version of myself possible! Please reach out to me at jacobjwkim@gmail.com, or through LinkedIn, which can be found at the bottom of this page along with my resume.
